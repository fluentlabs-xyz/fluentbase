# DESTRUCTIVE fault-injection assertion bodies for the DEFAULT-stack smoke cases,
# extracted so the combined `case-fault.sh` can chain them on ONE bring-up while
# each remains a standalone `case-<name>.sh` (same function, its own bring-up) for
# isolated debugging.
#
# Unlike asserts.sh (read-only), every function here MUTATES the stack — it
# restarts / SIGKILLs / CPU-throttles / full-stops nodes — BUT each one RESTORES
# the stack to a healthy, realigned state before it returns (its terminal
# assertion is the recovery check). So they can be chained least-invasive-first
# with fail-fast: a case only hands off to the next if its own recovery passed.
# `case-liveness` is deliberately NOT here — its kill/rejoin cycles can push the
# miss-count to a JAIL, which permanently shrinks the committee (unrecoverable);
# it must stay an isolated stack.
#
# MUST be sourced AFTER lib.sh (uses bring_up's globals + helpers: VALS,
# finalized_dec, baseline_height, check_external/check_node, peer_count,
# staking_call, shutdown_flushed, assert_beacon_window, wait_nodes_have,
# wait_finalized_ge, mixhash_*, ...). The caller owns bring_up_dpos +
# `trap tear_down EXIT`. On failure each function `exit 1`s (fail-fast, terminates
# the whole run + the trap tears the stack down); on success it `return`s so a
# combined runner continues to the next, more-invasive case.
# shellcheck shell=bash

# smoke-deferred: pins the deferred-execution (F-type) observables that the
# convergence-based cases cannot see — they only require cross-node EQUALITY,
# so a uniform finality overclaim (e.g. finalized == latest on every node)
# keeps all of them green:
#   1. K-lag invariant: eth "finalized" trails "latest" by exactly K in steady
#      state (never less — less = result-finality overclaim), and the
#      consensus namespace agrees (latestFinalized.height −
#      latestResultFinalized == K, latestResultFinalized == eth finalized).
#   2. result-commitment integrity: the ordering artifact at height N+K
#      carries `result` == the derived EVM block hash at N. Decoded from the
#      consensus_getFinalization wire bytes at the fixed codec offset
#      (parent 32 + height 8 + timestamp 8 + fee_recipient 20 + gas_limit 8
#      = byte 76; OrderBlock field order is part of the wire format).
#   3. EL-slowed validator: CPU-throttling one validator must not stall the
#      chain (verify budget → nullify, BFT f=1 holds); after unthrottle the
#      victim catches back up to the live tip.
# Run FIRST in the chain: its K-lag invariant wants a pristine steady state
# (before any node has been restarted/stopped by a later case).
