# Fluentbase Universal Token

`fluentbase-universal-token` provides primitives for Fluentbase's **Universal Token Standard (UST)**.
It exposes shared commands, constants, events, and storage schemas used to implement
execution-environment-agnostic token behavior across Fluentbase adapters.

This crate is designed to be consumed by Fluentbase contracts and runtimes that need a
single token model across EVM/SVM/WASM compatibility layers.

This crate is part of the [Fluentbase](https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/fluentbase) project.
