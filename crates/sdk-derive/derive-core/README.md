# Fluentbase SDK Derive Core

Internal helper macros used by `fluentbase-sdk-derive`. These macros are not
intended to be consumed directly. They provide lower level expansion utilities
that keep the public derive crate lightweight.

Changes to this crate may require regeneration of the snapshot tests in
`../snapshots`.

This crate is part of the [Fluentbase](https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/fluentbase) project.
