# Fluentbase SVM Shared

Common types and utilities used across the Fluentbase SVM crates. These helpers
allow sharing logic between the SVM runtime and the Solana compatibility
precompiles.

Currently this crate exposes bincode helpers and a few structures used in tests.
It is mostly an internal crate but is published separately to avoid code
duplication.

This crate is part of the [Fluentbase](https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/fluentbase) project.
