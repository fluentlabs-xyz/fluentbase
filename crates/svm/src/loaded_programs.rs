    Builtin re/deployment:
    - Empty => Builtin in TransactionBatchProcessor::add_builtin
    - Builtin => Builtin in TransactionBatchProcessor::add_builtin

    Un/re/deployment (with delay and cooldown):
    - Empty / Closed => Loaded in UpgradeableLoaderInstruction::DeployWithMaxDataLen
    - Loaded / FailedVerification => Loaded in UpgradeableLoaderInstruction::Upgrade
    - Loaded / FailedVerification => Closed in UpgradeableLoaderInstruction::Close

    Eviction and unloading (in the same slot):
    - Unloaded => Loaded in ProgramCache::assign_program
    - Loaded => Unloaded in ProgramCache::unload_program_entry

    At epoch boundary (when feature set and environment changes):
    - Loaded => FailedVerification in Bank::_new_from_parent
    - FailedVerification => Loaded in Bank::_new_from_parent

    Through pruning (when on orphan fork or overshadowed on the rooted fork):
    - Closed / Unloaded / Loaded / Builtin => Empty in ProgramCache::prune
