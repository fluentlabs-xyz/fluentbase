# Fluentbase Types

Shared primitive types, constants, syscall indices, and utility abstractions used across
Fluentbase crates.

`fluentbase-types` is `no_std`-friendly and intended as the common low-level dependency
for SDK, runtime, EVM integration, and system contracts.

This crate is part of the [Fluentbase](https://github.com/fluentlabs-xyz/fluentbase) project.
